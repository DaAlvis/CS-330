How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by starting with the purpose first, focusing on what the program needs to do and how it should feel to use. Once I have that vision, I organize the structure 
and flow before touching the code. I’ve learned that planning object relationships and scene structure up front saves a lot of cleanup later. I focus on keeping things efficient and 
visually balanced, especially in 3D work where spacing and lighting make or break realism.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me build a stronger understanding of lighting, texture, and spatial design. I got better at using UV mapping and learned how to make small visual tweaks that dramatically change how realistic something feels. It also pushed me to think more like a designer and less like just a coder by balancing the technical with the creative.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative process. I started with a very simple setup and then built up in layers, adding materials, testing lighting, adjusting textures, and rearranging objects as needed. Each round of testing taught me something new, and that cycle helped me create a more cohesive final scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The iterative design process is something I can apply anywhere. Breaking things into smaller steps, testing frequently, and refining as I go keeps projects flexible and reduces major errors later. Whether I am working on code, cybersecurity tools, or a visualization, that method makes it easier to adapt and improve.

How do I approach developing programs?
My development style is logical and modular. I try to make sure each section of code does one thing well and that everything is clearly commented and easy to understand. I’ve learned to prioritize readability and structure since future me, and anyone else looking at my code, will thank me for it.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I focused more on modularization, breaking out separate parts of the project into functions and classes. I also started using more consistent commenting and naming conventions to keep the logic clean. These habits made debugging and expanding the project much easier.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was the core of my workflow. I built small pieces, tested them, adjusted, and then moved on. Instead of rushing to a finished product, I treated each stage as its own mini project. That mindset made the final product stronger and gave me a clearer understanding of how everything connected.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At the start, I was focused mostly on getting things to work. By the end, I was more intentional, thinking about efficiency, structure, and clarity. I started coding with the end in mind instead of just reacting to problems as they came up.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me think systematically and problem solve creatively. It gives me tools to design smarter systems and automate complex tasks, which are both valuable in any sector of work.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It has helped me understand data and logic visually, which I can apply to simulations, modeling, and future courses. The technical side, especially lighting, physics, and transformations, ties into how I understand computational systems more broadly.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Visualization skills translate directly into communication, turning complex data into something people can see and understand. In cybersecurity and compliance, that is powerful. Being able to visualize system interactions, threat models, or network behavior helps bridge the gap between technical and non technical audiences.
